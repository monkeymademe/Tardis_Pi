# TardisPi

The TardisPi is a laser cut Tardis made from MDF. Its supposed to be connected to a Raspberry Pi and will host a few features.

## Laser Cut Tardis 

I used the laser cut template from thingiverse - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19824

So all you need to do is cut paint and glue.

## Project Tweeting Tardis

Tweepy is installed on the pi and its looking for the following keyword '#spintardis'.

The Pi has a Pimoroni explorer hat pro, Adafruit LED ring and a small motor connected to it.

When the user tweets '#spintardis' the tardis where ever it is connected and running will spin with the LED's making the base glow.

In addtion to the spinning the tardis also replies to the person tweeting with 1 of 5 images and a little text from the tardis.

Finally using the explorer hat pro there is a button connected to one of the input pin's allowing for the user who might be phyiscally there to press and make the tardis spin (good for no internet situations, of course it wont tweet then).
